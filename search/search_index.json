This means that they are stored separately in your database, and linked to. The benefit of this is that any time you have an object by \"B. Weigel\", instead of typing \"B. Weigel\" or \"Brandon Weigel\" or another form in the Name field, you select the canonical name from a list, and create a link to the \"B. Weigel\" entity. Same with Genre, Role, and Subject.</p> <p>In order for our migrated metadata to be accurate, those terms and names must be correct and consistent across all Islandora objects. Each different value under <code>&lt;genre&gt;</code> will create a separate taxonomy entry -- it will be bad for your repository to have \"Book\", \"book\", \"books\", and \"Books.\" as different options with different objects collected under them.</p> <p>Similarly, you don't want your repository collecting some works under \"B. Weigel\" and others under \"Brandon Weigel\" if they all belong to the same author.</p> <p>This cleanup task must be done before the migration, because the creation of those terms is automated.
